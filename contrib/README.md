# The contrib directory

The contrib directory is used as an unorganized (or, at best, lightly
organized) bin of various useful things contributed by either the core
developers, the community, or some time travellers just casually passing by.

The scripts in this directory and its sub-directories are provided as-is and
aren't necessarily actively maintained by the Jur Engineering.
